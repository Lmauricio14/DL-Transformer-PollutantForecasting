# Machine Learning for Temporal Forecasting: Transformer-Based Approach to Predict Coarse Particulate Matter (PMCO) Concentrations in Mexico CitY

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields, including science, technology, business, and economics. A significant public health and environmental concern is the concentration of suspended particles, or Particulate Matter (PM), especially in densely populated urban areas like Mexico City. Coarse Particulate Matter (PMCO), with micrometric sizes between 2.5 μm and 10 μm in diameter, is of special concern due to its ability to penetrate the lungs and bloodstream.

For this study, we use data provided by the Automatic Atmospheric Monitoring Network (RAMA), managed by the Ministry of the Environment of Mexico City (SEDEMA). RAMA is responsible for monitoring and recording air quality in this large metropolis. The study specifically focuses on PMCO particles.

## Tools and Database Used

For this study, the following tools and database were used:

- **Python** and its libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/PyTorch) for data processing and analysis.
- **Transformers** for predictive modeling.
- **RAMA Database (2022)**: Air quality data from Mexico City provided by the Automatic Atmospheric Monitoring Network.

## Data

We selected the RAMA database for the year 2022, avoiding the atypical years of the pandemic. Monitoring stations with complete and reliable records were chosen to ensure data quality.

The selection of monitoring stations was based on statistical rigor, ensuring data completeness and minimal missing values. The chosen stations for this study are:

- **BJU (Benito Juárez), Mexico City:** Exhibiting the lowest range of PMCO concentration.
- **MER (Merced), Mexico City:** Notable for a slightly higher maximum concentration.
- **UIZ (UAM Iztapalapa), Mexico City:** Shows higher average and standard deviation of PMCO.
- **TLA (Tlalnepantla), Mexico State:** Stands out with the highest maximum concentration and standard deviation, presenting a challenging dataset with a significant amount of missing values.

The database's key statistics, including minimum, maximum, mean values, standard deviation, and missing values, highlight the variability across stations, with TLA showing notably higher PMCO concentrations. Our methodology is designed to accurately forecast PMCO behavior even in datasets with many outliers and missing values.

In preparing the data for analysis, we prioritize databases with minimal missing data. Outliers are managed using a z-scores method with a ±3 standard deviation threshold, and missing values are addressed through multiple imputation.

## Probabilistic Forecasting with Transformers

our Transformer model's sophisticated design and strategic training are key in accurately forecasting PMCO concentrations, offering a powerful solution for environmental time series analysis.

- **Transformer Architecture**: Utilizes the Encoder-Decoder structure, excelling in handling sequential data with its attention mechanism.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses selectively on important data parts, crucial for time-dependent PMCO prediction.
  
  - Attention Formula: `Attention(Q, K, V) = Softmax((QK^T) / sqrt(d_k))V`
  - Self-Attention: `Self-Attention(X) = Softmax((XW^Q(XW^K)^T) / sqrt(d_model))XW^V`

- **Model Design**: Balanced with 4 layers each in the encoder and decoder, tailored to match our data structure.
- **Training Process**: Systematic training over 100 epochs, using batch sizes optimized for quality learning and prediction accuracy.
- **Optimization**: Employing the AdamW optimizer for effective learning rate adjustments.
- **Forecasting**: Capable of making predictions over various time intervals, validated using the RMSE metric for accuracy.
